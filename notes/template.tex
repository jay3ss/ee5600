\section{Introduction}
\textbf{Optimal control} deals with finding control laws for a system that meet 
some criteria of optimality \cite{wiki:1}. In classical controls we were 
concerned with the \textit{instaneous} control (having an output reach a
certain reference or setpoint) optimal control concerns itself with the
process over the \textit{entire} period that the process takes place.
